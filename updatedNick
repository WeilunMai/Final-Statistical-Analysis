#holiday variable
#do agents even answer phone calls on weekends? 
#does each day of the week get its own coefficient? 
#weekend variable
#monday variable
#tuesday variable
#wednesday, thursday, friday variable
#take out zeros from aht. 
#does the call volume go up from week to week? Nope!

#slight correlation with AHT. Why are there outliers(4,10)? Can we use the weekID as a factor, 
#or is this cheating? 
#why is there such a large range of agent seconds/time of day(=19,19.5)? 
#Is it just because smaller volume, more variance?
